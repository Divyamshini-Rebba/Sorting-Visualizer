# Sorting-Visualizer
Sorting Visualizer is a web application that visually demonstrates various sorting algorithms in action. This project provides an interactive and educational way to learn and understand how different sorting techniques work by animating the process step-by-step.

Features
Interactive Visualizations: Watch the sorting process unfold in real-time through dynamic bar representations.
Custom Input: Enter your own array of numbers to visualize how it gets sorted.
Random Array Generation: Generate arrays of random sizes (ranging from 5 to 100) and values to test sorting algorithms.
Multiple Algorithms Supported: Includes five popular sorting algorithms:
Bubble Sort
Selection Sort
Insertion Sort
Merge Sort
Quick Sort
Customizable Speed: Adjust the speed of the visualization for better understanding or faster results.
Responsive Design: Works seamlessly on all screen sizes.
Reset and Stop Options: Reset the array or stop the sorting process mid-way.
Purpose
This project was built to provide a better understanding of sorting algorithms and their complexities through visual demonstrations. It's an excellent tool for students, educators, and anyone looking to grasp sorting concepts intuitively.


Technologies Used
HTML: Structure and layout of the web application.
CSS: Styling for the bars, buttons, and layout.
JavaScript: Core logic for implementing and animating sorting algorithms.



How It Works
1.Select a sorting algorithm from the dropdown menu.
2.Choose the size of the array or enter a custom array.
3.Click on "Generate Array" to render the bars.
4.Click "Sort" to visualize the selected algorithm in action.
